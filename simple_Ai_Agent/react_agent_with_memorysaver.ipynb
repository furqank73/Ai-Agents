    "The **ReAct Agent Architecture** is a powerful pattern used to build more intelligent AI agents. **ReAct** stands for **Reasoning + Acting**. This architecture allows a model not only to **think** (reason) but also to **do things** (act) using external tools like calculators, APIs, search engines, or custom functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ The Aim of ReAct\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct enables an AI agent to **interleave reasoning and actions** in steps so it can solve complex problems that require external information or multiple steps of thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows a simple loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step        | Description                                              |\n",
    "| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Act**     | The AI decides to call a specific tool or take an action |\n",
    "| **Observe** | The AI gets back the result/output from the tool         |\n",
    "| **Reason**  | The AI thinks about what to do next based on the result  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it repeats the cycle until it reaches the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 How ReAct Works (Step by Step Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say the agent is asked:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"What's the population of France minus the population of Germany?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal model might hallucinate. But a ReAct agent does this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reason** → \"I don’t know the populations, I should look them up.\"\n",
    "2. **Act** → Calls a `search_population` tool for France.\n",
    "3. **Observe** → Tool returns: *Population of France = 67 million*.\n",
    "4. **Reason** → \"Next, I need Germany population.\"\n",
    "5. **Act** → Calls `search_population` tool for Germany.\n",
    "6. **Observe** → Tool returns: *Population of Germany = 83 million*.\n",
    "7. **Reason** → \"Now I can subtract.\"\n",
    "8. **Act** → Performs subtraction.\n",
    "9. **Final Answer** → \"Germany has 16 million more people than France.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Why ReAct Is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "| Benefit                 | Explanation                             |\n",
    "| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Reduces hallucinations  | Because it uses verified tool outputs   |\n",
    "| Better problem solving  | Breaks tasks into steps                 |\n",
    "| Real-world capabilities | Can use APIs, databases, calculations   |\n",
    "| Multi-step workflows    | Decisions improve with each observation |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Intuition Behind the Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of ReAct as how **humans solve problems**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Think → Do → Check Result → Think Again → Do Next Step → Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s exactly what ReAct enables in AI agents.\n",

      "Summary: In machine learning, deep learning focuses on utilizing multilayered neural networks to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and representation learning. The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and is centered around stacking artificial neurons into layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be \n",
